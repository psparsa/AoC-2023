This is a collection of my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges.

### What's Advent of Code (AoC)?

Advent of Code is an annual programming event occurring throughout December. Created by Eric Wastl, it features daily coding puzzles with varying levels of difficulty. Participants solve these challenges using their preferred programming languages and can engage in discussions and share solutions within the event's online community. The puzzles often have a thematic storyline, making the event both educational and entertaining.
